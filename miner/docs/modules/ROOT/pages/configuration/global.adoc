= Global settings

The global settings, that you pass to the miner with the `--settings` argument, is under the JSON format.

Schema of the file is available in the xref:configuration/index.adoc[Configuration] page.

Examples of this file can be found in link:https://github.com/RakambdaOrg/ChannelPointsMiner/blob/main/src/examples/config[src/examples/config,window="_blank"].

== Login method

[WARNING]
====
link:https://twitter.com/TwitchSupport/status/1575571090994102272[Twitch changed their authentication method in September 2022], now requiring calls to an integrity endpoint.
Old methods using `HTTP` or `MOBILE` may not work anymore.

Options working :

* `BROWSER`: It is in my opinion the safest but is requiring a selenium node/grid to be available (beware of `SE_NODE_GRID_URL` as CDP connection is required).
* `TV`: Simulates using the Android TV app, easy to set up.

== Streamer directories

To override streamer settings for a given streamer, you can place a JSON file within one of the defined directories, named by the streamer name and containing the overrides.

.Override default streamer settings for my_streamer1, my_streamer2 and my_streamer3

== Analytics settings [[analytics_settings]]

Analytics settings define a way to collect data on your twitch account as time passes.
This includes:

* Balance evolution
* Your own Predictions made & results
* Predictions from other chat participants and their return-on-investment (only approximate as the bet amount is mostly anonymous).

These are stored in an external database which allows any external software to access it and process it the wanted way.

Several database types are supported and listed below.
Each database (logical database for MariaDB/MySQL, different file for SQLite) will however represent one mined account.
You'll therefore have to adjust the settings for each mined account to not point to the same one.

=== Analytics database [[analytics_database_settings]]

link:https://www.baeldung.com/java-jdbc-url-format[JDBC url]:

* MariaDB: `jdbc:mariadb://host:port/database` (great if you have a DB available or running inside docker as you can set a mariadb container)
* PostgreSQL: `jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database` (just like MariaDB, reliable and efficient for both local and Docker setups)
* SQLite: `jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/file` (great running locally and want to store it to a file, however less resilient and more prone to corruption).
